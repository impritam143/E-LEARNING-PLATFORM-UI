DURATION: 4 WEEKS

DESCRIPTION OF THE TASKS: 
The E-Learning Platform UI is a multi-page front-end project designed to give users a modern, user-friendly experience while browsing and learning through online courses. This project was developed using HTML, CSS, and basic JavaScript as part of my internship task at Codtech IT Solutions Pvt. Ltd. The main goal of this project is to design a good-looking and interactive interface that shows how a real online learning platform might work.
The platform layout is designed with easy navigation and clear structure. It helps users to view courses, track their progress, and even watch learning videos. The pages are fully responsive, meaning they look good on both computers and mobile devices. The focus was to build the front-end only, so no actual backend or login system is included in this version.

 Main Features of the UI
Home Page:
The homepage has a simple and attractive welcome message with buttons like “Browse Courses” or “Start Learning.” It includes a header, banner section, and highlights of key features (like flexible learning, top instructors, etc.).

Course Listing Page:
This page shows all available courses in a grid or card format. Each card has a course title, image, short description, and a “View Details” button. This makes it easy for users to scroll and select a course they’re interested in.

Course Details Page:
Once a course is clicked, it opens the course detail page. It includes the course name, full description, what you’ll learn, lessons included, and embedded video content using a YouTube iframe. This gives a realistic feel of how an online course might look.

Progress Tracking:
I added simple progress bars under each course to show how much of the course is completed. Although this version doesn’t track real user progress (since there's no backend), it gives a good visual idea of progress tracking in learning platforms.

JavaScript: For simple interactivity, like toggling menus and switching between views
This project helped me understand how to structure multi-page websites and manage content across different sections. I practiced responsive design techniques using Flexbox and media queries, and improved my CSS layout and design skills. I also learned how to embed videos, use icons, and organize files in a frontend project.
It also taught me how important UI/UX design is in real-world projects. Even without backend or real data, a clean interface can help users understand and interact with the platform easily.
The E-Learning Platform UI is a complete, visually appealing frontend project that shows my ability to build real-world user interfaces. It is flexible and can be connected to a backend or learning management system (LMS) in the future. It represents my design thinking and frontend skills learned during my internship.
